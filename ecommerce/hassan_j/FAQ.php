	  Q: Do you ship worldwide?<br />
	  A: Yes! We ship worldwide! However, there are some locations we are

	  restriction, it will be stated on the product\'s page.<br /><br />

	  Q: Does TOM offer shipping options other than EMS for packages 
	  shipped from Japan?<br />
	  A: EMS is our only shipping option at this time. EMS is considered 
	  to be the fastest and most reliable international shipping service.
	  However, some countries do not accept EMS packages. Please click 
	  here to check if your country accepts EMS packages. If your country 
	  or area does not accept EMS packages, we might be able to ship your 
	  order via an alternate method. We welcome you to contact us for 
	  further details about how we can best assist you.<br /><br />

	  Q: How much does shipping cost?<br />
	  A: The shipping cost varies per product. By adding products to your 
	  cart and accessing the Cart page, you can instantly view the 
	  shipping charge prior to completing your order. The shipping charge 
	  will change if you add or deduct products. Your country\'s 
	  government may require customs taxes or other clearance fees to be 
	  paid before delivery. Local taxes and fees of this nature are not 
	  included in the shipping costs or Grand Total of your order. TOM 
	  has no control over and is not able to provide compensation for 
	  customs taxes or any related local charges.<br /><br />

	<p><br />
	  Q: Once I have placed my order, how long does it take for it to be 
	  shipped?<br />
	  A:Products that are currently in stock will ship within two 
	  business days. Pre-order products will ship upon their official 
	  release by the manufacturer. Made-to-order products and TOM Special 
	  Creator products will ship after they are produced. The amount of 
	  time needed to manufacture made-to-order and TOM Special Creator 
	  products may vary depending upon the item.<br />
	  ATTENTION: Due to a possible increase in orders during the holiday 
	  season, shipments might be delayed by an additional 1-3 business 
	  days. We deeply appreciate and are grateful for your support and 
	  understanding. We will continue working our hardest to ship packages 
	  within the promised 2 business days to best serve you and all otaku 
	  around the world.<br /><br />

	  Q: How long does shipping take?<br />
	  A: Shipping usually takes about 1-2 weeks, but varies by location. 
	  Shipping to Asia and Australia takes approximately three days to a 
	  week. Shipping to North America and Europe takes approximately 1-2 
	  weeks. Shipping to Central and South America takes approximately 2 
	  weeks.<br /><br />
	</p>
	<div class="bordure2"></div>
	<p><br />
	  Q: Will my entire order ship together in one shipment?<br />
	  A: It is likely that your order will ship in multiple shipments, 
	  because we ship products of an order as they become available. For 
	  example, an order containing a pre-order product, a TOM Special 
	  Creator item, and an artbook may be shipped in three different 
	  packages. The artbook would be shipped right away because this type 
	  of item is available in our warehouse, the TOM Special Creator item 
	  would be shipped in 1-2 weeks after it is produced because this type 
	  of item is made to order, and the pre-order product would be shipped 
	  once it releases from the manufacturer.<br /><br />
	</p>

	<p><br />
	  Q: My order contains pre-order products releasing in different 
	  months. Will they ship separately? Will I be charged for additional 
	  shipping?<br />
	  A: Yes, pre-order products will ship separately to you as they 
	  release. However, you will not be charged additional shipping costs. 
	  All shipping costs will be included in the original Grand Total of 
	  your order. Please note that shipping charges do not include any 
	  potential customs duties, taxes, or fees.<br /><br />
	</p>
	<div class="bordure2"></div>
	<p><br />
	  Q: How do I know when my pre-order product will ship?<br />
	  A: We are often only told the expected month a pre-order product 
	  will release. This information is written on the product's page. If 
	  you would like more specific information, please contact us during 
	  the month the pre-order product is expected to release. In the case 
	  a pre-order product's release is delayed by the manufacturer, 
	  customers will be contacted.<br /><br />
	</p>
	<div class="bordure2"></div>
	<p><br />
	  Q: It's been over a week and my product hasn't shipped. What is the 
	  delay?<br />
	  A: Your product might be a TOM Special Creator product! Such 
	  products include art prints, smartphone cases, blankets, and more. 
	  These items are specially made once you order them. This process 
	  takes about 1-2 weeks. Therefore, please allow 1-2 weeks to pass 
	  before shipment for such products. If you are not sure if your 
	  product is a TOM Special Creator product, please contact us.<br />
